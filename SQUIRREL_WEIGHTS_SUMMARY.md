# Squirrel Model Weights - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: The previous implementation was using general COCO-trained YOLOv11 models that don't have a specific "squirrel" class, and there was no actual downloading or use of squirrel-specific weights.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive system that prioritizes custom squirrel-specific weights while providing fallback to general animal detection models.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Primary Detection Path: Custom Squirrel Weights
```
Custom .pt weights → Ultralytics YOLO → Squirrel-specific detection
```

### Fallback Detection Path: General Animal Models  
```
QAI Hub YOLOv11 → COCO classes → Animal filtering (bird, cat, dog, etc.)
```

## 📁 New Files Created

### 1. `squirrel_model_weights.py`
**Purpose**: Core model management for squirrel-specific weights
**Key Features**:
- `SquirrelModelManager` class for handling custom model weights
- Support for YOLOv8/v11 PyTorch weights (.pt files)
- Automatic fallback to QAI Hub models
- Model validation and class verification
- Device optimization (CPU/GPU)

**Usage**:
```bash
python squirrel_model_weights.py --model yolov8n_squirrel --test
python squirrel_model_weights.py --info
```

### 2. `setup_custom_weights.py`  
**Purpose**: Helper script for setting up custom model weights
**Key Features**:
- Creates proper directory structure (`models/custom/`, `models/downloaded/`)
- Comprehensive README with training instructions
- Model validation utilities
- Example model download

**Usage**:
```bash
python setup_custom_weights.py --setup
python setup_custom_weights.py --validate models/custom/squirrel_weights.pt
python setup_custom_weights.py --instructions
```

## 🔧 Modified Files

### 1. `gstreamer_camera_detection.py`
**Changes Made**:
- Updated `ObjectDetector` class to use `SquirrelModelManager`
- Added model selection parameter (`--model`)
- Prioritizes custom squirrel weights over general models
- Enhanced detection logic with squirrel-specific handling
- Added model info display (`--info` flag)

**New Command Options**:
```bash
python gstreamer_camera_detection.py --model custom_squirrel --test
python gstreamer_camera_detection.py --model yolov8n_squirrel --info
python gstreamer_camera_detection.py --model yolov8s_squirrel --camera 1
```

### 2. `requirements.txt`
**Changes Made**:
- Added `ultralytics>=8.0.0` as primary dependency
- Moved `qai-hub-models` to fallback position
- Removed `roboflow` from required dependencies (commented out)
- Added clear hierarchy: Ultralytics → QAI Hub → Other

### 3. `download_squirrel_model.py`
**Changes Made**:
- Updated setup process to include Ultralytics installation
- Added custom weights directory creation
- Enhanced next steps instructions
- Clarified the difference between custom weights and general models

## 🎮 Model Options Available

### Custom Squirrel Models
1. **`custom_squirrel`** - Your own trained squirrel weights
   - Place `.pt` file at: `models/custom/squirrel_weights.pt`
   - Best performance for actual squirrel detection

### Pre-configured Models (using base weights)
2. **`yolov8n_squirrel`** - YOLOv8 Nano (fastest)
3. **`yolov8s_squirrel`** - YOLOv8 Small (balanced)

*Note: These currently download base YOLOv8 models. In production, these would be actual squirrel-trained weights.*

## 🔄 Detection Flow

### 1. Model Loading Priority
```
1. Try loading custom squirrel weights (Ultralytics YOLO)
2. If failed, try base YOLOv8 model (Ultralytics YOLO)  
3. If failed, fallback to QAI Hub YOLOv11 (COCO classes)
```

### 2. Detection Logic
```python
# Custom squirrel model detected
if detection.is_squirrel or class_name == 'squirrel':
    triggers.append('squirrel')  # High priority

# General animal classes (fallback)
elif class_name in ['bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'etc']:
    triggers.append(class_name)  # Lower priority
```

### 3. GPIO Triggering
```
squirrel detected → GPIO pin 17
bird detected    → GPIO pin 18  
cat detected     → GPIO pin 22
dog detected     → GPIO pin 23
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy torch
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
python download_squirrel_model.py --setup
```

### 3. Test with General Animal Detection
```bash
python gstreamer_camera_detection.py --test --model yolov8n_squirrel
```

### 4. Add Custom Squirrel Weights (Optional)
```bash
# Set up custom weights directory
python setup_custom_weights.py --setup

# Place your trained squirrel model
cp your_squirrel_model.pt models/custom/squirrel_weights.pt

# Test with custom weights
python gstreamer_camera_detection.py --test --model custom_squirrel
```
